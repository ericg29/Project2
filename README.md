# Project2

The goals of this project were:
  1. To overhaul the styling and layout of the website
  2. To add office location to the datatbase and relevant webpages
  3. To reduce the number of session variables used throughout the site.
  
In a previous project, we were given code for the original website. In that project, we were required to: 
  1. Add meeting locations to appointments
  2. Modify majors in the database to use abbreviations (e.g. Computer Science = CMSC), but still display the full major names on all relevant pages
  3. Remove redundant code
  4. Add documentation

Project 1 was an individual project while Project 2 was completed in a group with 2 other students.

The original website code and the Project 1 code can be found in their respective folders for reference.
